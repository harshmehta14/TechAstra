# E4W (Education for Women)

This website is created during IEEE Hackathon (Ideate: Breaking the Barriers).


## Description

The main focus of this website is to provide good quality education and build a strong STEM Foundation for learners, especially in Remote Areas. Learners can avail the benefits of the reward system available on the website which would engage them more in education. With the help of this website, successful women in the STEM-specific domain would interact virtually and encourage the users to take up the domain and also provide career counselling based on their choices. The quizzes conducted using the website would help them to understand the topics better, and they can analyze their results and work accordingly in their interested domain. The website solves the problem of social norms by providing rewards and conducting an online counselling sessions for family members to make sure they understand the importance of education.

If provided a chance we would like to develop hologram-based content for better understanding.
We would like to include a career counselling chatbot with a voice assistant in multiple languages in the future. Also, we would like to add features such as voice translators to reach a wide range of users, employing the users who have completed their courses to create content in their regional language which will also help the website to grow.

We are also planning on building an online meeting platform that works well even during the fluctuation of the network (as there is poor network connectivity in Rural Areas).
